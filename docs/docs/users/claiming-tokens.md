- 0.1 BTC → 1 LBTY
- 1 BTC → 10 LBTY
- 10 BTC → 100 LBTY
```

### "Signature Invalid" Error
- Ensure you copied the EXACT message (including capitalization)
- Check that you signed with the correct Bitcoin address
- Try a different Bitcoin wallet

### "Insufficient Balance" Error

- Check your balance on [blockchain explorer](https://blockstream.info)

### PSBT Won't Verify
